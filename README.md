# Portfolio Watch

This project is my Phase 5 final project at the Flatiron software engineering bootcamp. 

### Description 
The main use of the Portfolio Watch app is so users can keep track of equity and stock holdings in one place and see up to date info on how their holding are doing throughout a trading session. Personally I use Vanguard to hold my investments but one thing that I wish it offered was live feedback of stock price movements. 

## User Stories (As a User I can):
- Create a portfolio account to keep track of all stock holdings.
- Have a custom tailored news feed that shows news articles about the stocks they own. 
- Add stocks by their ticker to their portfolio(buy) and adjust the quantity of shares they own(sell).
- See the performance of their holdings during a trading session.
- Have a personalized stock watchlist where they can add and remove stocks that they want to track the price as well as other info like trading volume, minute to minute open, close, high, low data in a candlestick chart, as well as other valuable information specifically for that stock. 
- See detailed information about the past transactions that they have made.

### Main Technologies Used:
- JavaScript with React for the front end
- Recoil for state management in React
- Python with Flask to created a SQL backend
- Semantic Ui for css styling and prebuild components
- Apex-charts react library for live stock charts
- Material Ui for tables
- Formik and yup for form validations (also bycrypt to encrypt user passwords via hashing)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
