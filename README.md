# Portfolio Watch

This project is my Phase 5 final project at the Flatiron software engineering bootcamp. 

### Description 
The main use of the Portfolio Watch app is so users can keep track of equity and stock holdings in one place and see up to date info on how their holding are doing throughout a trading session. Personally I use Vanguard to hold my investments but one thing that I wish it offered was live feedback of stock price movements. 

## User Stories (As a User I can):
- Create a portfolio account to keep track of all stock holdings.
- Have a custom tailored news feed that shows news articles about the stocks they own. 
- Add stocks by their ticker to their portfolio(buy) and adjust the quantity of shares they own(sell).
- See the performance of their holdings during a trading session.
- Have a personalized stock watchlist where they can add and remove stocks that they want to track the price as well as other info like trading volume, minute to minute open, close, high, low data in a candlestick chart, as well as other valuable information specifically for that stock. 
- See detailed information about the past transactions that they have made.

### Main Technologies Used:
- JavaScript with React for the front end
- Recoil for state management in React
- Python with Flask to created a SQL backend
- Semantic Ui for css styling and prebuild components
- Apex-charts react library for live stock charts
- Material Ui for tables
- Formik and yup for form validations (also bycrypt to encrypt user passwords via hashing)
